# A Web Blog
## web-blog-with-python-flask-mongodb

This project is a prototype of a web blog and is based on the [Udemy class](www.udemy.com/the-complete-python-web-course-learn-by-building-8-apps/) tutored by Jose Salvatierra.

It uses:
+ Python 3 to write all the code
+ Flask to power the web app
+ MongoDB as a database
+ Bootstrap 3 to style the templates
